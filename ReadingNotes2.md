## TDD ##

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

The test file name should follow the same name of module name. For instance, if our module is gender.py, our test name should be test_gender.py.

Other thing to care about is the structure. A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.
Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
Now you can execute the tests. I suggest the lib pytest to do it. But you are free to choose anything you like.

an important thing about TDD: the cycle.
The cycle is made by three steps:
ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isnâ€™t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
ðŸ”µ Refactor the code â€” the first version doesnâ€™t need to be the beautiful one (donâ€™t be shy)

The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace
Beginning may be hard â€” and thatâ€™s fine. You just need to practice!

## Recursion ##

What is Recursion?

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 

How a particular problem is solved using recursion? 
The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion.
